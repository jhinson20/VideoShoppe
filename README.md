# Video Shoppe

##Description

The "Video Shoppe" project was a group effort project by Micheal Knight, Stanislaw Kansiewicz, and Jordan Hinson. The project was created for a computer science course at Francis Marion University begining in Spring 2021 and ending in Fall 2021. My purpose in being a part of this project was to learn how applications were made and to learn different types of technolgies used in making said applications. Initial assignment that led to the creation of the Video Shoppe application was to make an inventory tracking and personel management software for a small fictional video store. The initial requirements were then fleshed out into a functional applicaiton. By participating in this project I learned about project structure and different technolgies.

##Installation

To use this application simply install it from this repository using the green code button and unzip it. You can then open the project in an IDE. The application was mostly created an ran in IntelliJ by Jetbrains, but it should funciton properly in any Java IDE. Specifically for IntelliJ after opening the project you will need to copy all 3 of the fxml files from src/main/java/VShoppe into the target/classes/VShoppe folder. After doing so, you should be able to go to the Controller.java file in src/main/java/VShoppe and run the file. Upon doing so the application should launch and any login will work to proceed past the login screen.

##Usage

Unfortunately, the project was not completed by the end of the due date and and cannot function properly without the proper database and connections being setup on a machine. For this reason, I have slightly modified the code to allow for logins with any credentials so that the UI can be viewed. This means that virtually none of the functionality will exist without the database, but the UI and code itself can be traversed.
